This is your evaluation for Homework 4.

=========================================


General
20 / 20: Ball and SoccerSim files exist

Ball
10 / 10: Ball class exists/compiles
10 / 10: constructor exists and takes arguments
0 / 10: Handles boundaries/checks if outOfBounds (can be part of SoccerSim)
15 / 20: Keeps track of position
15 / 20: Keeps track of speed
8 / 10: Friction is applied

Clock
40 / 40: Clock functionality exists
10 / 10: Clock uses accurate time slice

SoccerSim
10 / 10: SoccerSim class exists/compiles
10 / 10: main/constructor exists and sets up the simulation
10 / 20: Parses parameters correctly
10 / 10: Validates arguments
10 / 10: Creates and tests pole
0 / 10: Creates initial report
10 / 10: Creates report after every time slice
10 / 10: Creates final report
10 / 10: Collision detection

Tests
0 / 50: 5 Tests

Extra Credit:
10 / 10: Code quality


TOTAL: 208 / 300 points

Notes:
The ball moves and its friction is applied every second, not every time slice.
The time slice is just when we capture the new movement, but it moves multiple times
within that slice (depending on how long the slice is).

There's a few issues in here - not taking into account the default time slice, etc. 
so the tests didn't work.
