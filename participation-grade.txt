Hi,
Here is your participation grade for the semester.

Each day is worth 5 points. If you let me know that you were going to be absent,
then you received 3 points. If you didn't come to class without letting me know,
then you received 0 points. If you had already finished the assignment and let
me know that you were going to miss class for that reason, that counted as
being present that day.

There were 27 days of class, so 135 total possible points.

Everyone gets 4 bonus days (20 points). If you completed the end of course survey
you received another bonus 5 points.

It is possible to get over 100% on participation.

My records show that you missed 2 days: 3/26, 4/4

Present Days: 25 x 5 = 125
Missed Days: 2
Excused Days: 0

+ 20 points bonus
+ 5 points end of course survey

TOTAL: 150 / 135
