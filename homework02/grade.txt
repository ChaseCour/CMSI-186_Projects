Extra Credit:
5 / 10 : Code quality

TOTAL: 284 / 300 points

NOTES:
The HighRoll was confusing because you have to sets of instructions that use different
letters for the options! 

The Die class states that it is supposed to throw the IllegalArgumentException.

The whole part in the constructor where you create int[] sides was unnecessary.

The "sideUp" variable is what "pips" was supposed to be.

You should use "this." in front of private variables (i.e. this.pips)

setSides() wasn't filled out.

DiceSet constructor is supposed to throw an IllegalArgumentException.

isIdentical() doesn't quite work because the die in each set might not be in the same order.

The indentation / comments etc. were a bit messy.
