Hi,

Here is the evaluation of your Homework #5, the Riemann Sums exercise.

The Riemann.java file must exist.  It must have a main method and needs
to handle at a minimum the "runtests", the "poly", and the "sin" functions
on the command line.  In addition there are argument validations that must
be handled including:

   - detecting no arguments
   - detecting the correct number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion (no letters)
   - percentage value set to default if not on command line
   - percentage validated and set properly if it IS on the command line

At minimum, there should be methods to handle the "poly" and the "sin"
integration functions.  

The "runMyTests" method must exist and must allow for the tests to be run
using the command line "pseudo-function" called "runtests".  There must
be AT LEAST one test.

Testing will be done using the script files that were sent to you during
the development of your project.  There are 6 tests for input validity.
There are 5 tests for up to 2nd degree polynomials, and one test for a 5th order polynomial.  There are 5 tests for the sin function.

There must be at least one file in the repo: the Riemann.java file.

Your source code style is important for this project, and will continue
to be so for the rest of the semester.  Make sure you indent properly
and consistently, that your variables have good names, there is NO code
that is left in that is not needed [commented out], and that you have
comments to help explain what the code does without being overly
loquacious.

It is possible to get more than 100% on this assignment.  The total percent
will be applied to the 15% that this exercise is worth overall.  For example,
if you get the maximum credit, you will get 370 out of 300, which is 123.333%.
This means you will get 18.5 points for this 15-point exercise.

18 / 20 points: Riemann.java exists and compiles no errors
5 / 10 points: Checks args and throws exceptions
10 / 10 points: Main method runs with no errors
0 / 30 points: runtests functionality exists and runs at least one test
30 / 30 points: Code to handle polynomial function exists and a decent attempt was made
30 / 30 points: Code to handle sin function exists and a decent attempt was made
20 / 60 points: Tests valid inputs (6 tests/10 points each)
30 / 50 points: Tests second degree polynomials (5 tests/10 points each)
10 / 10 points: Tests fifth degree polynomial (1 test)
20 / 50 points: Tests sin (5 tests/10 points each)


BASE POINTS: 173 / 300


Extra Credit:
10 / 10 points: Cosine
10 / 10 points: Tangent
10 / 10 points: Log
10 / 10 points: Exponent
10 / 10 points: Square root
0 / 10 points: Composite
10 / 10 points: Code quality

EXTRA CREDIT POINTS: 60 / 70


TOTAL POINTS: 233 / 300


NOTES:
Minus a couple points because it's supposed to be Riemann not Reimann (therefore my tests
didn't work and I had to change things).

Well organized and well commented code! It wasn't necessary to split it out into two files
but it made the code very clean and easy to read.

You're not handling bad arguments. Also if there is a problem with the arguments you should throw an exception not just print an error (I didn't take off points for that part though).

You didn't do runMyTests
